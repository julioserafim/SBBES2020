    <p class="text-justify">
      Code smells are poor code structures that might harm the software quality and evolution.
      However, recent work has shown that only individual occurrences of smells may not be enough to assess
      the real impact that these smells can bring on systems. In this context,the co-occurrences of code smells,
      i.e., occurrences of more than one code smell in the same class or same method, can be better indicators
      of design problems for software quality. Despite its importance as an indicator of design problems,
      we have little known about their impact of removing the co-occurrence of smells via software refactoring
      on internal quality attributes, such as coupling, cohesion,complexity, and inheritance.
      We aim at addressing this gap through a qualitative study with 14 developers.
      To this end, we analyze there factorings employed by developers during the removal of
      60 codes mells co-occurrences, during 3 months in 5 closed-source projects.
      We observe (i) impact of code smells co-occurrences on internal quality attributes,
      (ii) developers’ perceptions during the removal of code smells co-occurrence via refactoring activities,
      (iii) which are the most harmful co-occurrences to internal quality attributes,and (iv)
      which are the most harmful co-occurrences from the developers’ perspective.
      Our findings indicate that: (i) the refactoring of some types of code smells co-occurrences
      (e.g., Dispersed Coupling–God Class) indicated improvement for the quality attributes,
      (ii)refactoring code smells co-occurrences according to the developers is difficult mainly
      due to the understanding of the code and complexity refactoring methods,
      (iii) developers still have insecurities regarding the identification and refactoring of code smells
      and their co-occurrences.

    <!-- <h3 id="qualitymetrics" class="page-header">Coupling Metrics</h3>
		<p class="text-justify">

           Coupling measures how much a SPL component provides functionalities to other components, or depends on functionalities provided by other components. That is, coupling metrics aim at capturing when SPL components are strongly attached to the whole SPL. Thus, a high coupling suggests that the SPL components are strongly attached to other components and, therefore play an essential role in the operation of the product line. On the other hand, a low coupling suggests that the SPL component is not essential to operate the product line. In order to characterize critical components in component-based SPL, we used the following conventional coupling metrics. The first column presents the name of each metric. The second column describes the metric.

		<h3 id="detectionstrategy" class="page-header">Detection Strategy</h3>
		<p class="text-justify">
			The figure below presents our metric-based strategy for characterizing critical components. A detection strategy combines multiples metrics to characterize components that satisfy a property, the component criticality in our case. We assume that both FANIN and CBO explicitly capture coupling between critical components. Based on the literature of component-based SPL, a critical component is the one that has too many dependencies with other components, which we can measure with CBO > Threshold and FANIN > Threshold. However, from our viewpoint, FANOUT > Threshold may not suffice to characterize critical components because, considering the SPL architecture, each component tend to use features provided by several other components. However, when a component is deeply located in the inheritance tree and has too many children components, such external dependencies indicated by FANOUT > Threshold may negatively impact on the SPL product configuration, which makes the critical components. Thus, FANOUT has to be combined with DIT > Threshold and NOC > Threshold for capturing critical components.
