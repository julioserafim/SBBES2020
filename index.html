		<p class="text-justify">
            Previous studies demonstrated how code smells (i.e., symptoms of the presence of system degradation) impact the software maintainability. However, few studies have investigated which code smell types tend to co-occur in the source code. Moreover, it is not clear to what extent the removal of code smell co-occurrences -- through refactoring operations -- has a positive impact on quality attributes such as cohesion, coupling, inheritance, complexity, and size.  We aim at addressing these gaps through an empirical study. 
            By investigating the impact of the smells co-occurrences in 11 releases of 3 closed-source systems, we observe (i) which code smells tend to co-occur together, (ii) the impact of the removal of code smell co-occurrences on quality internal attributes before and after refactoring, and (iii) which are the most difficult co-occurrences to refactoring from the developers’ perspective. Our results show that 2 types of code smell co-occurrences generally tend to co-occur. Moreover, we observed that the removal of code smells co-occurrences lead to a significant reduction in the complexity of the systems studied was obtained. Conversely, cohesion and coupling tend to get worse. We also found that two code smells co-occurrences <i>(God Class - Long Method) </i> and <i>Disperse Coupling - Long Method)</i> as the most difficult to refactor indicating that attention is needed to not insert these anomalies in the source code.
            Based on our findings, we argue that further research is needed on the impact of code smells co-occurrences on internal quality attributes.

		<p class="text-justify">

           Coupling measures how much a SPL component provides functionalities to other components, or depends on functionalities provided by other components. That is, coupling metrics aim at capturing when SPL components are strongly attached to the whole SPL. Thus, a high coupling suggests that the SPL components are strongly attached to other components and, therefore play an essential role in the operation of the product line. On the other hand, a low coupling suggests that the SPL component is not essential to operate the product line. In order to characterize critical components in component-based SPL, we used the following conventional coupling metrics. The first column presents the name of each metric. The second column describes the metric.

		<p class="text-justify">
			The figure below presents our metric-based strategy for characterizing critical components. A detection strategy combines multiples metrics to characterize components that satisfy a property, the component criticality in our case. We assume that both FANIN and CBO explicitly capture coupling between critical components. Based on the literature of component-based SPL, a critical component is the one that has too many dependencies with other components, which we can measure with CBO > Threshold and FANIN > Threshold. However, from our viewpoint, FANOUT > Threshold may not suffice to characterize critical components because, considering the SPL architecture, each component tend to use features provided by several other components. However, when a component is deeply located in the inheritance tree and has too many children components, such external dependencies indicated by FANOUT > Threshold may negatively impact on the SPL product configuration, which makes the critical components. Thus, FANOUT has to be combined with DIT > Threshold and NOC > Threshold for capturing critical components.
